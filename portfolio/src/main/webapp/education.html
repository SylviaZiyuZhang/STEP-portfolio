          <p>My high school, Northeast Yucai School (东北育才学校/NEYC), is located in Shenyang, China. Built by
          Japanese
          colonizers about a century ago, it went through several
          significant adjustments and became a province flagship STEM school in recent decades. While the
          majority of the graduates of NEYC go through the Chinese college entrance exam, the school still
          provides us with a variety of elective courses and extracurricular opportunities.</p>

        <h1> Here are a few random facts about my high school journey</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I served as the president of the student body for two years.</li>
          <li>I learned gas pistol and volleyball in my P.E. classes.</li>
          <li>I learned to code in the competitive programming class of the school. As computer science wasn't
            a required class in the standard curriculum, I couldn't have been here without the help of my
            high school coach.</li>
